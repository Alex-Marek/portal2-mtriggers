# Portal 2 mtriggers

This repo contains a collection of
[SAR](https://github.com/p2sr/SourceAutoRecord/) speedrun categories for
individual Portal 2 maps (also known as 'mtriggers'), primarily intended for use
in challenge mode (CM).

## Contributing

All contributions to these triggers are welcome; feel free to open a PR, or
message me an improvement on Discord (mlugg#6618).

Note that because of the squash-based workflow used, PRs may be merged manually;
this means they may show on GitHub as 'closed' rather than 'merged'. Don't
worry; your changes have still made it in!
